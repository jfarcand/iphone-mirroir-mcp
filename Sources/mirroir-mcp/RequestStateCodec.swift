/// onto a different request, or present it long after it was issued. Each is
/// covered here — the payload is authenticated with HMAC-SHA256, bound to the
/// method that issued it, and expires.

/// The signing key is generated per process, so state does not survive a server

/// already over, and failing it is the correct outcome.
