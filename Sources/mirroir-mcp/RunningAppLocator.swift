/// loop runs in a common mode. The MCP server spends its entire lifetime
/// blocked in `readLine()`, so that snapshot freezes at whatever the process
/// last observed. When the target app relaunches — an iPhone respring restarts
/// ScreenContinuity — the frozen snapshot keeps the terminated instance and its
/// dead PID, and reports `isTerminated == false` for it because that property is
/// refreshed by the same run loop. Every AX call against the dead PID then fails
/// with `kAXErrorCannotComplete`, which a bridge reports as `.noWindow` for the
/// rest of the server's lifetime; nothing short of restarting the server clears
/// it, and quitting the target app does not help.

/// Launch Services answers from live state, so these lookups stay correct across
/// target restarts without any run loop trip.
