# Known Limitations

## Focus Stealing

Every input tool (`tap`, `type_text`, `press_key`, `swipe`, `drag`, `long_press`, `double_tap`) must make iPhone Mirroring the frontmost app before sending input events. This means the tool will steal keyboard focus from whatever app you are currently using.

### Why

CGEvent input is routed by macOS to the frontmost application. There is no API to direct input events to a background window.

### What This Means in Practice

If you are typing in a terminal or editor and an MCP tool fires, iPhone Mirroring will become frontmost and your terminal loses focus. After the tool completes, iPhone Mirroring retains focus — the server intentionally does not switch back to avoid per-call Space jitter.

Read-only tools (`screenshot`, `describe_screen`, `start_recording`, `stop_recording`, `status`, `get_orientation`, `check_health`, `list_skills`, `get_skill`) use the Accessibility API and do **not** steal focus.

### Mitigations

| Strategy | How It Helps |
|----------|-------------|
| **Separate macOS Space** | Put iPhone Mirroring in its own Space. The activation triggers a Space switch, so your cursor position and text selection in the other Space are preserved. |
| **Skill runner** | Chain multiple steps in a single skill (SKILL.md or YAML). Focus is acquired once at the start rather than stolen between each individual tool call. |
| **Batch your MCP work** | Run a sequence of phone interactions together, then return to your other work. Interleaving phone commands with terminal typing will cause repeated focus switches. |

### Alternatives That Don't Work

| Approach | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| Accessibility API actions | AX actions can trigger menu items (Home, App Switcher) but cannot simulate touch input on the mirrored display. |
| Clipboard paste (`Cmd+V`) | iPhone Mirroring does not bridge the Mac clipboard when paste is triggered programmatically. Tested with HID, AppleScript, and `CGEvent` — none work. |
| `NSRunningApplication.activate()` | Deprecated in macOS 14 with no replacement for cross-Space activation. Cannot reliably bring iPhone Mirroring to front. |

## Keyboard Layout Gaps

When the iPhone uses a non-US keyboard layout (e.g., Canadian-CSA), the server translates characters through `UCKeyTranslate` to find the correct keycodes. Two characters on the ISO section key (`§` and `±` on Canadian-CSA) cannot be typed because macOS and iPhone Mirroring disagree on the key mapping for that physical key. These characters are silently skipped.

## No On-Screen Keyboard

iPhone Mirroring acts as an external hardware keyboard, so iOS hides the virtual on-screen keyboard. There is no iOS setting to override this — it is a hard platform limitation.

### Impact on Testing

- Screenshots and OCR will never show the iOS keyboard. Tests that need to verify keyboard appearance, custom input accessories, or keyboard-driven UI cannot be validated through iPhone Mirroring.
- Text input itself works fine — `type_text` and `press_key` deliver keystrokes via CGEvent regardless of whether the virtual keyboard is visible.

## iOS Autocorrect

iOS applies autocorrect to typed text the same way it does for physical keyboard input. Words may be silently changed after a space or punctuation is typed. Disable autocorrect in iPhone **Settings > General > Keyboard** if this causes issues.
