// ABOUTME: The acceptance test for the whole runner loop — boot, browser, capture, oracle, verdict, rerun, drift, accept, break, artifacts, lockfile.
// ABOUTME: Drives a real chromium against a served copy of the web fixture from an adopter-shaped `.mirroir/` plan; no stub npx anywhere.

//! Full-loop end-to-end suite.
//!
//! Every other integration suite in this directory stubs `npx` and asserts one
//! feature. This one runs the loop an adopter runs, in order, against a real
//! browser: a `.mirroir/` plan, a project-local archetype, one scenario whose
//! web steps form a single contiguous block, and the process / HTTP / oracle
//! hooks that sit around it.
//!
//! Thirteen phases, each observed rather than assumed:
//!
//! | # | Phase | What it proves |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1 | BOOT | the scenario spawns the static server and waits for its port |
//! | 2 | WEB | one contiguous web block compiles to exactly ONE `npx` invocation |
//! | 3 | CAPTURE | the confirmation leaves the browser on the captures attachment |
//! | 4 | ORACLE | the judge post-hook consumes that captured value |
//! | 5 | NON-WEB | the HTTP probe, the kill and the log scan run around the browser |
//! | 6 | VERDICT | PASS, exit 0 |
//! | 7 | RERUN | an identical second run is PASS and the compose cache hits |
//! | 8 | DRIFT | reworded prose, unchanged behavior → exit 65 and a drift-log row |
//! | 9 | ACCEPT | `mirroir-run accept` regenerates the baselines |
//! | 10 | GREEN | the next run is PASS again |
//! | 11 | BREAK | broken behavior → exit 1, carrying Playwright's own message |
//! | 12 | ARTIFACT | the persisted workspace still holds spec, reports and trace |
//! | 13 | SUPPLY | one tampered byte inside a locked archetype fails `--frozen` |
//!
//! The browser leg is gated on `MIRROIR_PLAYWRIGHT_HOME`, the signal the
//! repository's CI lanes already use for "Playwright is provisioned here". A
//! host without it reports that it did not run the loop, loudly, on the real
//! stderr; a host that claims a browser and cannot produce one fails.
