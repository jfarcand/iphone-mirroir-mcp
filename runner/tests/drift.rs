// ABOUTME: The third verdict end-to-end — a reworded page drifts, a broken page fails, a bare metric errors.
// ABOUTME: Drives the built binary against runner/samples/web-fixture with a stub npx and a stub oracle.

//! DRIFT verdict suite.
//!
//! Playwright has `passed`, `failed`, `timedOut`, `skipped` and `interrupted`.
//! None of them says "every assertion is green, the log is clean, and the
//! semantics moved". These tests pin the state that does.
//!
//! The subject is the web fixture's drift pair:
//! `samples/web-fixture/public/summary.html` and its reworded twin. Both
//! render the same DOM, respond to the same click, and set the same
//! `data-test` attribute; only the confirmation's prose differs. The scenario
//! driving them, `samples/web-fixture/scenarios/order-summary.yaml`, ships in
//! the repository and runs live against real Chromium; here a stub `npx`
//! supplies the Playwright report and a loopback stub answers the judge, so
//! the suite needs no Node, no browser, and no network.
