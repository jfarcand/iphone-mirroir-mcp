# CI integration

How downstream consumers (e.g., Atmosphere samples, mirroir-skills test
suites) call `mirroir-run` from their own CI. The reference is
[`.github/workflows/runner.yml`](../../.github/workflows/runner.yml) in
this repository.

## Job shape

`runner.yml` defines seven jobs. Five are test lanes; two are guard jobs
(`runner-deny` runs `cargo deny check`, `publish-rehearsal` runs
`cargo publish --dry-run --locked`).

`runner-full-loop` and `runner-smoke` both branch off `runner-fast`;
`runner-full-loop` runs `runner/tests/e2e_full_loop.rs`, the acceptance test
that drives the whole loop against a real chromium in one run — boot, one
Playwright invocation, the capture channel, the judge, the runner-side hooks,
PASS, an idempotent rerun, DRIFT, `accept`, green again, a real break, the
artifacts it leaves, and the lockfile gate. The suite reports `NOT RUN` and
stays green on a host that provisioned no browser, so the lane also greps its
output for `FULL LOOP: 13/13 phases observed` — a vacuous pass fails the lane.

Lanes downstream of `runner-fast` use the `needs:` keyword so they only
spin up runners after the fast lane is green — saves runner-minutes on
PRs that have a basic regression.

## Path filters

The workflow only triggers when files under `runner/**` or the workflow
file itself change. This keeps Swift-only commits from spending runner
time on Rust CI and vice versa.

## Caching strategy

| Cache | Key | What it stores |
|---|---|---|
| Cargo registry + git + `runner/target` | `Swatinem/rust-cache@v2`, shared-key per lane | crates.io index, downloaded crates, incremental compilation artifacts |
| Playwright browsers | `playwright-${{ runner.os }}-<cache-key>`, set by `.github/actions/setup-playwright` | `~/.cache/ms-playwright` (Linux), `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` (macOS) |
| Ollama models | `ollama-${{ runner.os }}-qwen2.5:0.5b-v1` | `~/.ollama/models` (~400 MB for the qwen2.5:0.5b judge model) |

Bump the trailing `-v1` suffix to force a cache rotation when the
underlying tool's binary digest changes (e.g., Playwright minor-version
bump).

## Why Ollama and not OpenAI

`mirroir-run`'s `byte-stable` judge profile targets a local Ollama daemon.
CI installs Ollama on every fresh runner and uses it for judge scoring. No
secrets, no per-run cost, byte-stable across reruns at `temperature=0`.

The `fast-ci` profile (OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`) is documented and supported
for local users who prefer hosted scoring, but never invoked in CI to keep
the workflow free of remote-LLM dependencies.

### Profile trust boundary

Built-in profiles and the user's home config
(`~/.mirroir/oracles/profiles.yaml`) are trusted: they may set a profile's
`base_url` / `api_key_env` / `model` / `timeout_s` and define new profiles.
Repo-local config (`<repo>/oracles/profiles.yaml` and
`<repo>/.mirroir/oracles/profiles.yaml`) is untrusted: it may only tune
`model` / `timeout_s` of an existing profile. A repo-local `base_url` /
`api_key_env` change or a brand-new profile is ignored with a warning, so a
checked-out repository cannot redirect judge prompts and API keys to an
attacker-controlled host.

Independently, the judge's `user_prompt_template_hash` is verified on every
run: a scenario that pins a stale hash hard-fails with
`RunnerError::JudgeTemplateMismatch`, so a changed oracle template can never
silently invalidate a scenario's reproducibility guarantee.

## Consuming the runner from another repo's CI

Every `runner-v*` tag publishes prebuilt binaries for
`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `x86_64-apple-darwin`,
`aarch64-apple-darwin`, and `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, plus the crate on
crates.io and a formula in the `jfarcand/homebrew-tap` tap. Pick whichever fits
the lane; no lane needs to build from source.

```yaml
- name: Install mirroir-run (prebuilt, static musl)
  env:
    MIRROIR_RUN_VERSION: 0.2.0
  run: |
    base="https://github.com/jfarcand/mirroir-mcp/releases/download/runner-v${MIRROIR_RUN_VERSION}"
    curl -fsSL "${base}/mirroir-run-v${MIRROIR_RUN_VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz" \
      | tar -xz -C /tmp
    sudo install "/tmp/mirroir-run-v${MIRROIR_RUN_VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/mirroir-run" \
      /usr/local/bin/mirroir-run

- name: Install Playwright + Ollama (see runner-e2e in the upstream workflow)
  run: |
    # ... same install + cache pattern as runner.yml ...

- name: Drive your sample
  run: mirroir-run --sample path/to/your/sample
```

The other two install paths:

```bash
cargo install mirroir-run --locked          # crates.io
brew install jfarcand/tap/mirroir-run       # Homebrew (macOS arm64/x86_64, Linux x86_64)
```

Each release archive ships a `.sha256` sidecar next to it; verify it when the
lane's threat model calls for it.

## Exit codes

| Exit | Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `PASS` | All scenarios in the chosen set passed and nothing drifted |
| 1 | `FAIL` | One or more scenarios failed; check stderr for the typed `RunnerError` |
| 65 | `DRIFT` | Every structural assertion held and at least one drift metric moved past its threshold |
| 64, 66-71 | — | Reserved (per `sysexits.h` convention; not currently used by the runner) |

The runner never returns successfully with a partial pass — `must_pass`
scenarios must all be green. It does return a *third* code, and the lane
decides what that means:

```yaml
- name: Drive the sample
  run: |
    set +e
    mirroir-run --sample path/to/sample
    code=$?
    set -e
    case "$code" in
      0)  echo "PASS" ;;
      # A drifted run held structurally and moved semantically. Uploading the
      # candidate rows and continuing is the usual choice; `exit 1` here makes
      # drift block the merge instead.
      65) echo "DRIFT — review .harness/drift-log.md"; cat .harness/drift-log.md ;;
      *)  exit "$code" ;;
    esac

- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: always()
  with:
    name: drift-candidates
    path: .harness/drift-log.md
    if-no-files-found: ignore
```

`--diff-text` returns 65 on drift too, so the code means one thing everywhere.

### Never `accept` in CI

The way out of a DRIFT is `mirroir-run accept`, which re-records every baseline
from what the run observed. That is a person saying the new output is correct.
A CI job that ran it would bless its own regressions and report green forever,
so the refusal is structural rather than a convention this document asks you to
follow: `accept` exits non-zero the moment it finds `CI`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS`,
`GITLAB_CI`, `BUILDKITE`, `CIRCLECI`, `JENKINS_URL`, or any of the other CI
markers set. Adding it to a workflow turns the lane red, not green.

The intended flow is: CI reports 65 and uploads `.harness/drift-log.md`; a
person reads the rows, runs `mirroir-run accept` on their machine, reviews
`git diff`, and commits the moved baselines. See
[drift-and-accept.md](drift-and-accept.md).

### Drift thresholds in CI

Drift comparison is fail-closed: a metric no layer of the hierarchy declares
stops the run with `unspecified drift threshold for <metric>` (exit 1). A lane
that runs scenarios with `judge:` steps therefore needs a `drift-defaults.yaml`
reachable from the invocation — in the sample directory, at `--skills <dir>` /
`$MIRROIR_SKILLS`, in the working directory, under `<cwd>/.mirroir/`, or under
`$HOME/.mirroir/`. See the README's "The three verdicts" section for the
metrics and their starting values.

The baseline drift is measured against lives at `.harness/last-green.json`,
relative to the invocation directory. A fresh CI runner has none, so the first
run of a scenario records one and passes; cache or commit that file only if the
lane genuinely wants cross-run drift detection.

### Report artifact

The `.mirroir/` pipeline writes a JSON run summary to the path given by
`--report` (default `mirroir-run-report.json`). CI can upload it as a
build artifact for post-mortem. The shape is `RunSummary`:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "config_path": "/abs/path/.mirroir/mirroir.yaml",
  "generated_at": "2026-06-19T03:00:00Z",
  "samples": [ /* per-sample SampleVerdict entries, in plan order */ ],
  "totals": { "samples": 3, "passed": 2, "failed": 0, "drifted": 1, "skipped": 0 }
}
```

Schema `2` added the third verdict: `samples[].verdict` is one of `"pass"`,
`"fail"`, `"drift"`, `"skipped"`, `"composed"`, and `totals` carries a
`drifted` count. The four strings a version-1 consumer already grepped for are
unchanged.

## Verbose logging in CI

Set `RUST_LOG=debug` to see the dispatcher's per-step trace:

```yaml
- run: RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/mirroir-run --sample samples/foo
```

Output is line-oriented `tracing-subscriber` formatted; pipe through
`grep` / `awk` to slice. The `runner-e2e` lane tails the Ollama daemon
log on failure for post-mortem.

## Matrix expansion

The current workflow runs on `[ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]`. To add
Windows (not currently supported — `nix` SIGTERM handling is unix-only):

1. Implement the non-unix `send_group_sigterm` / `send_group_sigkill`
   stubs in `runner/src/target/process_log.rs` (currently no-ops under
   `#[cfg(not(unix))]`; `process.rs` only calls them).
2. Add `windows-latest` to the matrix.
3. Adjust Ollama install (Windows uses the `.exe` installer).

Tracking the Windows port: open a GitHub issue with the `os:windows`
label when you need it.

## Sample expansion: driving many samples

This repository ships a single end-to-end fixture,
[`runner/samples/mega-sample`](../samples/mega-sample), exercised by the
`runner-e2e` lane. A downstream consumer drops a `SAMPLE.md` next to each
source it wants `mirroir-run` coverage for, then runs each from its own
CI:

```yaml
- run: mirroir-run --sample path/to/sample-a --scenarios must-pass
- run: mirroir-run --sample path/to/sample-b --scenarios must-pass
```

…or a single matrix job iterating over sample directories. See
[sample-md-format.md](sample-md-format.md) for the `SAMPLE.md` schema.

Consumer-specific sample integration lives in the consumer repo's own CI;
this runner's job is to be the binary they invoke, with stable exit codes
and structured logs.
